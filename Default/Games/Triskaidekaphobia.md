### Triskaidekaphobia 
#### Mill 13
#### Black Blue Purple
#### Special Rule: You may not play summons in your deck.

#### Passive -- Mind Lock: 
##### Apply one or more based on your opponent's colour identity:
##### - Grey, Red or Orange: They can only draw thirteen cards this game (Cards, effects and game mechanics that would have them draw one or more cards are ignored. Doesn't apply to effects that fetch.).
##### - Black, Yellow or Green: They can only mill thirteen cards this game (Cards, effects and game mechanics that would have them mill one or more cards are ignored. Doesn't apply to effect that bury.)
##### - White, Blue or Purple: They can only suspend thirteen cards this game. (Cards, effects and game mechanics that would have them suspend one or more cards are ignored. Doesn't apply to effects that exile.)

#### Passive -- Eyes into another world: 
##### During each turn, you may cast one card you own from the exile.
##### You may only cast cards whose total rank doesn't exceed thirteen this way during the game.

#### Brainwash:
##### Target twelve cards from the graveyards: for each card, either exile it or shuffle it into its owner's deck. Then, return one card from either graveyard to the field.

#### Triskaidekaphilia:
##### If exactly thirteen cards are on the field, you win the game.
